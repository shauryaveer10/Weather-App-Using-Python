# Weather-App-Using-Python
A program to show the correct weather along with date and time of any city in the world.
HOW IT WORKS
We can run the program and it'll ask for an input. We can add the city name and then it'll search on google.
I have used BeautifulSoup4 for my project and it'll search the data that is needed.
The exact date and time along with the weather will be displayed.
